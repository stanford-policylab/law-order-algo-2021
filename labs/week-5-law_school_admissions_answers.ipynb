First, we assume that students in our dataset comprise the full set of students who _applied_ to law school. In reality, our dataset only contains students who ultimately enrolled at a law school. Second, we assume that [students accepted to top-tier law schools](https://abovethelaw.com/2013/03/which-law-schools-had-the-highest-yield-rate/) all decided to enroll at a top-tier school. Finally, we assume that admissions decisions are based on a relatively small set of factors that we have access to: LSAT score, GPA, minority status, and family income. This is a coarse approximation of actual admissions policies, but is instructive nevertheless.\n",

    "* Are there important differences between the populations of interest that may influence the model in undesirable ways? Consider whether minority students are more likely to practice in jurisdictions with lower bar passage rates (e.g., NY or CA)? Consider whether stereotype threat or implicit bias might explain differences in academic or bar passage performance between white and minority students and what implications that has for the approach you've studied above."
