    "In this exercise, we'll examine admissions decisions at top-tier law schools using the dataset from the _LSAC National Longitudinal Bar Passage Study_ ([Wightman and Ramsey, 1998](https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED469370.pdf)).\n",
    "This study presents national longitudinal bar passage data gathered from the class that started law school\n",
    "in fall 1991 over a 5-year period.\n",
    "In our analysis, we will focus on diversity and affirmative action policies. We'll explore a simple method to reverse engineer admissions criteria, and investigate the extent to which race-blind policies can achieve diversity. We'll also consider the consequences on diversity of a hypothetical scenario in which admissions decisions are based on statistical likelihood of bar passage."

First, we assume that students in our dataset comprise the full set of students who _applied_ to law school. In reality, our dataset only contains students who ultimately enrolled at a law school. Second, we assume that [students accepted to top-tier law schools](https://abovethelaw.com/2013/03/which-law-schools-had-the-highest-yield-rate/) all decided to enroll at a top-tier school. Finally, we assume that admissions decisions are based on a relatively small set of factors that we have access to: LSAT score, GPA, minority status, and family income. This is a coarse approximation of actual admissions policies, but is instructive nevertheless.\n",

    "### Using Predicted Bar Passage as a Selection Criterion\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we consider what would happen if law schools selected students to optimize bar passage rates. This approach might be motivated from two perspectives. First, perhaps using an outcome-based algorithm would allow schools to lessen the weight on LSAT scores, given the critiques of standardized tests as favoring affluent non-minority groups, and hence constitute a \"workable race-neutral alternative.\" Second, more crudely, one of the major inputs into U.S News and World Report law school rankings is bar passage. Schools might want to admit a class to increase bar passage rates or U.S. News might increase the weight of bar passage in its rankings. Our goal here is to examine whether the adoption of such a policy is a workable alternative and whether it might have disparate impact.\n",

    "#### Exercise 4:\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a model to predict bar passage and then use this model to simulate an admissions cycle where the students predicted as being the most likely to pass the bar are admitted into the highest tier law schools. Create the predictive model using logistic regression as shown above.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose an admissions office came to you and proposed using this model to determine which students are admitted. How would you evaluate the model and what would you recomemnd to the admissions office? If this model were used, would there be a valid disparate action claim for any rejected applicants?"

    "\n",
    "* Are there important differences between the populations of interest that may influence the model in undesirable ways? Consider whether minority students are more likely to practice in jurisdictions with lower bar passage rates (e.g., NY or CA)? Consider whether stereotype threat or implicit bias might explain differences in academic or bar passage performance between white and minority students and what implications that has for the approach you've studied above."
